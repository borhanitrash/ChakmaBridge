# ChakmaBridge: A Five-Way Parallel Corpus for Navigating the Script Divide in an Endangered Language
## Abstract
The advancement of NLP technologies for low-resource and endangered languages is critically hindered by the scarcity of high-quality, parallel corpora. This is particularly true for languages like Chakma, which also faces the challenge of prevalent non-standard, romanized script usage in digital communication. To address this, we introduce ChakmaBridge, the first five-way parallel corpus for Chakma, containing 807 sentences aligned across English, Standard Bangla, Bengali-script Chakma, Romanized Bangla, and Romanized Chakma. Our dataset is created by augmenting the MELD corpus with LLM-generated romanizations that are rigorously validated by native speakers. We establish robust machine translation baselines across six diverse language and script pairs. Our experiments reveal that a multilingual training approach, combining English and Bangla as source languages, yields a dramatic performance increase, achieving a BLEU score of 0.5228 for Chakma translation, a 124\% relative improvement over the best bilingual model. We release ChakmaBridge to facilitate research in low-resource MT and aid in the digital preservation of this endangered language.
